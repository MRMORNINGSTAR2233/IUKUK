# Research Paper Implementation Roadmap

This repository contains a structured roadmap for implementing foundational and modern research papers across:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision (CV)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- Diffusion Models
- GANs
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

Each domain has its **own dedicated Markdown file** with checkboxes to track completion.

## 📚 Sections

| Area | File |
|------|------|
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | [NLP.md](NLP.md) |
| Computer Vision (CV) | [CV.md](CV.md) |
| Reinforcement Learning (RL) | [RL.md](RL.md) |
| Diffusion Models | [Diffusion.md](Diffusion.md) |
| Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) | [GANs.md](GANs.md) |
| Large Language Models (LLMs) | [LLMs.md](LLMs.md) |

## 📌 How to Use

- Each paper is listed with a **checkbox** (`[ ]` or `[x]`) to track progress.
- Links point to the original **arXiv papers** or official sources.
- You may implement in order or skip around by difficulty or interest.

Happy researching & coding 🚀
